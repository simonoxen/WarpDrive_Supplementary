# WarpDrive_Supplementary

This repository contains code and data to recreate figures from the Oxenford et al 2023 WarpDrive manuscript.

For the toolbox itself, we refer to the [3DSlicer SlicerNetstim extension](https://github.com/netstim/SlicerNetstim).

The folders figure_2 through 5 contain the code and derivative data to recreate the respective results figures. The code can be run in the environment defined in `environment.yaml`, simply `conda env create --file environment.yaml`.

For figure 1, the data is included as a Sample Data in 3D Slicer and can be downloaded and analyzed with WarpDrive. See details [here](https://github.com/netstim/SlicerNetstim)

For figures 6 and supplementary figure 1, the updated transforms can be downloaded from the [Data attached to the Release](https://github.com/simonoxen/WarpDrive_Supplementary/releases/tag/1.0) in this repository.
